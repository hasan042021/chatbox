## Implementation details

**Authentication and authorization**:

- Without login, user will be always redirected to login page. If user does not have an account, he/she will have to register an account
- After successfull login, users data will be stored to local storage for persistency
- JWT will be valid for 1 hour, after this time period user will be automatically logged out
- User can manually logout by clicking logout button

**Conversations**

- User can create a convesation or update existing conversation inside a modal.
- Whenever user types an user name, automatic checking of that user's existence will be done from backend
- User can not send message to himself/herself
- If both of those criteria are fulfilled, only then user will be able to add conversation or edit conversation
- For each conversation last message, user name and time is shown
- User does not need to load more conversation manually. Infinite scrolling is implemented.
- Cache is updated optimistically for editing and pessimistically for adding

**Messages**

- by sending new message, corresponding conversation will also update and a socket event is fired to each user, only relevant user will update their cache pessimistically
